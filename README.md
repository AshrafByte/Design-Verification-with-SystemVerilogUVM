# UVM Coursework – In Progress 🚧

This repository contains my ongoing coursework for mastering the **Universal Verification Methodology (UVM)** and building a complete SystemVerilog-based verification environment.

I'm currently enrolled in a comprehensive UVM course where I’m learning to:

- Build UVM agents and understand their roles in verification environments.
- Model design registers using UVM and connect them to APB interfaces.
- Set up a DUT (Device Under Test) and verify its functionality.
- Write random and constrained-random testbenches.
- Use functional coverage to assess verification completeness.
- Implement scoreboards and predictive models.
- Debug and enhance UVM environments using best practices.

> 🔧 **Status**: This project is a work in progress. I’m actively adding new components as I progress through the course tutorials.

## 🔍 Why This Repo?

I’m using this repository to track my learning journey and showcase my practical understanding of UVM and SystemVerilog. By the end of the course, this repo will contain a complete, scalable UVM-based testbench with 5000+ lines of well-structured verification code.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **SystemVerilog**
- **UVM**
- **EDA Playground**
- **QuestaSim / VCS (via EDA Playground)**

## 🎯 Goals

By the end of this course and repository development, I aim to:

- Build a full-featured UVM verification environment from scratch.
- Be confident in designing agents, scoreboards, and coverage models.
- Be well-prepared for internships and junior verification roles.
